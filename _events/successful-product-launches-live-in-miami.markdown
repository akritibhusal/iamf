****What is the Product Council?****

The Product Council provides startups and existing companies a fresh new outlet for critical feedback, ideation, and improvement of their products. 

Each month an audience of product makers (design, dev, etc.) and founders gather to learn valuable lessons and insights from experienced product owners as they dive deep into the challenge, success, and failure of product design. 

This is no demo or pitch, rather it’s an open examination of how to execute an idea. Join us this month for your opportunity to exchange product stories, network, and learn valuable lessons from seasoned product veterans.

**“The Meetup was excellent. In learning about practical approaches to product management, I'm able to better utilize my own product management toolbox to further develop an effective, productive and efficient product management system for our company. Thanks and I look forward to future Product Council meetups.” - Eric**
