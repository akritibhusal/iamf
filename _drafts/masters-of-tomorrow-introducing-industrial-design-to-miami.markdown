#Meet Today and Tomorrow’s Masters of Design#

As a once-aspiring entrepreneur and not-so-young professional, I’ve been lucky enough to work with a few people who are genuine, without a doubt, masters of their respective fields.

What I’ve come to realize is that some people just really are, quite literally, masterful at being human beings. I thought I could get away with just hard work, passion, and dedication, but there’s actually another level beyond that.

I’ve learned that to really qualify as one of these masters, you have to pretty much be a super good person, on top of being talented and successful. You have to be authentically authentic, not just fake it. You have to be humble, even though you have every right not to be.

You have to share what you’ve learned with others, not just to prove that you know things, but just because you honestly you really want to help them. And they are usually happy to listen because, probably not coincidentally, you’re always full of both positivity and knowledge, which is a very inspiring combination of qualities.
Listen up, you would-be masters of tomorrow: You should strive to not only achieve success for yourself but also light that spark within others. I know, amazing right?!
